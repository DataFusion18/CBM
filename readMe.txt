Carbon Balance Model (CBM)

A simple Carbon Balance Model (CBM) for an individual free growing plant seedling (Eucalyptus Tereticornis) for daily time scale:

The folder "Codes" includes: 
i) a R script for data processing and
ii) another R script performing a test case of MCMC applying in a simple carbon balance model. 

In the folder "Instruction_files" there are instructions to describe the Carbon Balance Model (CBM) structure, associated equations and the steps the R scripts are performing to process the necessary data. Another instruction file describes the MCMC parameter settings and the synthetic data generation.

All necessary data files that are called in the R scripts are stored in "Data_files" folder for easy access.

In the "Results" folder I have added few outcomes applying MCMC R script with our CBM (both with a synthetic data set and HIE pot experiment data set).
